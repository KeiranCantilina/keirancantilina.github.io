      <description>Timeline Jan 2017 - Jun 2018
Project Description This project was for my Masters thesis at the University of Minnesota. The objective of this project was to develop a cheap and more rugged alternative to conventional water conductivity sensors, which are often susceptible to corrosion and fouling despite being quite expensive. This flaw exists because water conductivity is conventionally inferred by measuring the electrical resistivity of the water, which requires the direct contact of metallic electrodes with the water under test.</description>

      <description>Timeline May 2018
Project Background A few weeks before my wife and I were to be apart for the summer (due to me studying abroad and her only able to join me there in the fall), my wife stumbled upon these &amp;ldquo;Long Distance Friendship Lamps.&amp;rdquo; I loved the idea, but I was less enthusiastic about the fact that the operation of the lamps depended on the continuous operation of the company servers.</description>

      <description>Timeline Aug 2017 - Sept 2017
Project Background This project began when I picked up a sad typewriter with a broken keyboard set out for free in front of the university library. Since I have a soft spot for obsolete technology, I gave it a new home. Repurposing it became a recreational exercise in both hardware-microcontroller and microcontroller-computer interfaces.
Project Description Images are broken down into lines of text by a Python script on a laptop, which then sends lines of ASCII via a serial-USB interface to an Arduino-style microcontroller.</description>
